The purpose of face landmark detection is to provide precise locations of facial keypoints, enabling various applications such as facial analysis, 
emotion recognition, face morphing, virtual makeup, augmented reality filters, and more. By accurately detecting and tracking these landmarks,
it becomes possible to understand and manipulate the structure of a face within images or video.
